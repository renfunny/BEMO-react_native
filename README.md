## Description

BEMO is an application created with React Native that allows the user to browse different stores and see what items they offer. The user can follow the store and like/comment on their posts. The user can also create their own store and post items for other users to see, search for other stores, and view the items all stores have to offer in the "Store" screen. The user will be able to see their friends list and navigate to their profile to see their posts. The application uses Firebase to store all the user's data, authenticate the user, and store each post. The application was created using Expo and the React Native framework. The Design of the application was created using Figma by Pedro Cordova (Graphic desgner). This project allowed me to further dive into the React Native framework and learn how to use Firebase to store data. It helped me understand how a social media app can be created and further my knowledge in React Native.

## Installation

The app has not been released on the app store, therefore, it cannot be oppened unless the code itself is downloaded. If so, open the source code in the terminal and use the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed, then use the command `npm run web` to open the application locally (Note that the app was designed for mobile only, therefore the web version will look very odd).

## Usage

This app can be used to browse different clothing items in an efficient manner. It allows the user to follow their favourite brands and like/comment on their posts. It also allows users to post their own items for sale for others to see.
